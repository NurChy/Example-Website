     <p>We started the creation of the site with a name. We came up with a name and a story for our clinic. The name of our clinic is “Twelve Moons”. Twelve Moons Medical Center was founded in 1998 by a talented cardiologist and entrepreneur Kibusuji Mudzan. He started his career in medicine in the late 1980s and quickly established himself as one of the best specialists in the field of cardiology.
        However, while working at a state hospital, Kibsuji Mudzan faced a huge number of problems: insufficient funds, ineffective treatment methods, long waiting for an appointment. These problems turned out to be fundamental in order to create your own medical center, which will take into account the needs of patients.
        At first, he started with a small office in one of the local buildings, where he provided consultations on cardiology. He worked hard and with great love for his profession, which allowed him to gain the trust of patients in a short time and gain a reputation as one of the best cardiologists in the region.
        A few years later, Kibusuji Mudzan decided to expand his business and create a full-fledged medical center that could provide a wide range of medical services to the population. He found a suitable location for the center and began gradually expanding it.
        All the main specialties were represented at the Twelve Moons Medical Center: therapeutic department, surgical department, pediatric department, gynecological department, dental department, neurology department, cardiology department, ophthalmology department, physiotherapy and rehabilitation department, as well as laboratory and pharmacy.
        The Twelve Moons Medical Center was equipped with the most modern medical equipment and had highly qualified medical personnel. Each employee was subject to strict inspection and mandatory training to ensure a high level of medical care.
